# An-Overview-of-Visualization-in-Mathematics-Programming-and-Big-Data

Visualization is a descriptive way to ensure the audience attention and to make people better understand the content of a given topic. Nowadays, in the world of science and technology, visualization has become a necessity. However, it is a huge challenge to visualize varying amounts of data in a static or dynamic form. In this paper we describe the role, value and importance of visualization in maths and science. In particular, we are going to explain in details the benefits and shortages of visualization in three main domains: Mathematics, Programming and Big Data. Moreover, we will show the future challenges of visualization and our perspective how to better approach and face with the recent problems through technical solutions.
